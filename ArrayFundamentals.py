# working with numpy to perform numerical/scientific operations on arrays
# three main characteristics of numpy arrays
# 1.) Homogenous Arrays
# 2.) You cannot add or remove elements from these arrays as you can do with lists but you can modify an array.
# 3.) Rectangular not jagged arrays - every row should have similar number of columns.


# initialize an array using a list
import numpy as np
